Problem:
P1. use Iterator to select rows from dataframe is too slow!!!! 
  Answer:Use dataframe to do select row or columns. It is faster than list and need less memory.
  
P2.pivot_table and melt function need too much memory. 16GB is not enough!!!
  A: Dont use pivote_table and melt function when data is so large. U can divide dataframe into a lot of little dataframes.
