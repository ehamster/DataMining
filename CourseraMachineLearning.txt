Problem:
  
Algorithm:
   1.Supervised: Give a set of data and right answer
      1).Regression : continuous valued output
      2).Classfication: predict a discrete value output
   2.UnSupervised:
      approach problems with little or no idea what our results should look like. 
      We can derive structure from data where we don't necessarily know the effect of the variables
