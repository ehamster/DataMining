Week2:

LIBNAME mydata  "/courses/d1406ae5ba27fe300" access = readonly;

DATA new; set mydata.addhealth_pds;// DATA setp
LABEL H1DA1="Times of working around the hourse during the past week"
	     H1DA2="Times of doing hobbies during the past week";  //表头
       
IF feature1 = 1;
IF feature2 LE 0;

//Logic部分：
= EQ
~= ^= NE
> GT
< LE
>= GE
<= LE
PROC SORT; by AID;  //将主键作为排序

PROC FREQ; TABLES feature1 feature2; //显示frequency
RUN; //execute above all

Week3:
Data management
1.data missing
  IF F1 = 9 then F1 = .;
	
2. Blank information
IF F1 = . Then F1 = 11;   /*空着和unknow不一样，空着和不回答是两回事。

3. Create secondary variable
ACTIVITY = H1DA1 + H1DA2;
IF ACTIVITY < 3 then ACTIVITY = 0;
ELSE IF ACTIVITY >= 3 then ACTIVITY =1;  
PROC PRINT; VAR H1DA1 H1DA2 ACTIVITY;  看看对不对

4. Category
IF H1DA1 = 0 THEN Group = 0;
ELSE IF H1DA1 = 1 THEN Group = 1;
ELSE IF H1DA1 = 2 THEN Group = 2;
ELSE IF H1DA1 = 3 THEN Group = 3;
ELSE Group = .;

Week4:
category:
PRO GCHART; VBAR F1/Discrete type = PCT width = 30; /*VBAR = 垂直 ; Discrete = category  PCT = percentage*/
PRO FREQ

quantitative:
PRO GCHART; VBAR F2/ type = PCT; 
PROC UNIVARIATE; VAR H1DA8;/*查看 mean median mode

2 variable relationship:
bar chart for 2 category
PROC GCHART; VBAR categorical_x_variable/discrete Type = mean Sumvar = categorical_y_variable;

scattorplot for 2 quantitative

PROC GPLOT; Plot y_variable * x_variable

Week 1
As long as adequately large samples and an adequantly large number of samples are used from a population, the 
distribution of the statistics of the samples will be normally distributed

Hypothesis Testing
1.Specify the null(H0) and the alternate(Ha) hypothesis(定义两个猜测)
2.Choose a sample
3. Access the evidence
4.Draw conclusions

P Value <= 5%  (Significance level of a test) Reject null hypothesis   -- h0 是错的
P value > 5% data do not provide enough evidence to accept the Ha   -----H1是错的
p value = the number of times out of 100 we would be wrong in rejecting the H0

3种 statictical tools：
ANOVA analysis of variance
x2 - chi Square test of independence
r - correlation coefficient

C -> Q (ANOVA)
C -> C (x2)
Q -> Q (pearson correlation r)
Q -> C (x2)


1.ANOVA F test:
    are the differences among the sample means due to true difference among the population means or
    merely due to sampling variability
    F = variation among sample means / variation within groups
    
    So, F is big, 两个因素是相关的，Ha接受

	PROC ANOVA; Class explanatory variable;
	MODEL response variable =  explanatory variable;
	MEANS explanatory variable;
if explanatory variable more than 2 group, ANOVA do not tell us which groups are different from the others!!

1-2 Using post hoc test to see difference when x feature is more than 2 categories
one of post hoc is DUNCAN test

	MEANS explanatory variable/DUNCAN;

Incorrectly rejects the H0 ---Type 1 error
